# Async to Sync Aggregator Module for OpenHAB

## Introduction

The Async to Sync Aggregator module is designed for OpenHAB systems to synchronize the state of a switch item based on updates from a group of items. This module is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple asynchronous events need to be aggregated, and their collective state needs to reflect on a single switch item. It's ideal for home automation tasks where you want to monitor a set of sensors or devices and change the state of a control item based on their collective status.

## Purpose and Use

This module aggregates asynchronous events from a specified group of items and updates a switch item to indicate whether the events are in sync or not. It's useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that all items in a group are in a particular state before triggering a specific action. For example, it could be used to check if all doors and windows are closed before activating a security system.

## System Requirements

- JavaScript (ECMAScript 2022+) binding must be enabled in OpenHAB.
- OpenHAB JS

## Installation

### Step 1: Navigate to the OpenHAB Automation Directory

Access the `automation/js` directory within your OpenHAB configuration directory. This directory is the target location for installing the module.

In an OpenHABian installation the directory is /etc/openhab/automation/js 

### Step 2: Install the Module

    ```bash
    npm install openhab-asynctosync
    ```

### Step 3: Usage

To use the Async to Sync Aggregator module in your OpenHAB setup, you will need to initialize it within your JavaScript rule file. Here's an example of how to instantiate the module:

```javascript
const AsyncToSyncAggregator = require('./'openhab-asynctosync'');

new AsyncToSyncAggregator('GroupName', 'SyncSwitchName');
```

## Example Useage


To synchronize events from a car using the [MQTTCarPresence](https://github.com/aderusha/MQTTCarPresence) library, define your items as follows:

```plaintext
Switch                  CAR_AudiQ7_Sync_Switch                    "Audi Q7 Sync"                      (gAudiQ7)

Group                   CAR_AudiQ7_Sync                           "Audi Q7 Sync"                      (gAudiQ7)                      {Async_Time="6"}
Number                  CAR_AudiQ7_WIFI_Signal_Strength           "Audi Q7 Signal"                    (CAR_AudiQ7_Sync)        {channel="mqtt:homeassistant_AudiQ7_2Dsignal:Queen:AudiQ7_2Dsignal:AudiQ7_2Dsignal_5Fsensor#sensor"}
Number                  CAR_AudiQ7_Uptime_Seconds                 "Audi Q7 Uptime"                    (CAR_AudiQ7_Sync)        {channel="mqtt:homeassistant_AudiQ7_2Duptime:Queen:AudiQ7_2Duptime:AudiQ7_2Duptime_5Fsensor#sensor"}

## Metadata Configuration

The `Async_Time` metadata plays a crucial role in the functioning of the Async to Sync Aggregator module. It defines the time frame within which all the items in a group need to be updated to consider the events as synchronized.

### Setting the `Async_Time` Metadata

For the module to work correctly, you must set the `Async_Time` metadata on your group item. This metadata specifies the maximum allowed time (in seconds) for the items in the group to update their states to be considered in sync.

For example:

```plaintext
Group   CAR_AudiQ7_Sync   "Audi Q7 Sync"   (gAudiQ7)   {Async_Time="6"}
```
